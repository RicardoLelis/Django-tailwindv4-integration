# Driver Workflow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Driver Not Being Redirected After Accepting Ride
**Problem**: After accepting a ride, drivers stayed on the offers page instead of being redirected to the ride details.

**Solution**: Updated `accept_offer` view in `driver_booking_views.py` to handle AJAX requests properly:
- Added JSON response for AJAX requests with redirect URL
- Updated dashboard JavaScript to handle the response and perform redirect

### 2. Driver Status Reset on Page Refresh  
**Problem**: When drivers refreshed the page while online, they were forced offline.

**Solution**: 
- Driver status is already persisted in database via `DriverSession` model
- Fixed dashboard template to disable development mode: `const DEVELOPMENT_MODE = false;`
- Now the dashboard checks actual driver status from the database on page load

### 3. Rides Not Being Sent to Drivers
**Problem**: When riders created pre-booked rides, online drivers weren't receiving notifications.

**Solution**: Updated `BookingService._schedule_matching_task()` to:
- Immediately find all online drivers (active DriverSessions)
- Use MatchingService to evaluate each driver
- Create offers for suitable drivers
- Send email notifications via NotificationService

### 4. Accepted Rides Not Added to Driver Calendar
**Problem**: When drivers accepted rides, they weren't appearing in their calendar.

**Solution**: Updated the workflow to automatically add accepted rides to driver calendar:
- Modified `PreBookedRide.assign_driver()` to call `CalendarService.add_booking_to_calendar()`
- Added calendar entry creation with proper time slots
- Calendar now shows all accepted rides for planning

## Additional Improvements

### Created Missing Templates
- `driver/calendar/calendar.html` - Driver calendar view
- `driver/offers/offer_list.html` - List of available ride offers  
- `driver/bookings/booking_list.html` - Driver's accepted bookings
- `driver/bookings/booking_detail.html` - Individual booking details

### Fixed Model Field References
- Updated all references from `pickup_datetime` to `scheduled_pickup_time`
- Added missing accessibility fields to `PreBookedRide`
- Added booking reference fields to `DriverCalendar`

### Database Migrations Created
- `0010_add_accessibility_fields.py` - Adds assistance fields to PreBookedRide
- `0011_add_calendar_fields.py` - Adds booking reference to DriverCalendar

## How It Works Now

1. **Rider Creates Booking**
   - Booking is saved to database
   - System immediately searches for online drivers
   - Suitable drivers receive offer notifications

2. **Driver Accepts Offer**
   - Offer status updated to 'accepted'
   - Booking assigned to driver
   - Driver redirected to booking details
   - Booking automatically added to driver's calendar

3. **Driver Status Persistence**
   - Going online creates a DriverSession
   - Status persists across page refreshes
   - Going offline ends the session

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Ride Notifications**:
   - Have a driver go online
   - Create a pre-booked ride as a rider
   - Driver should receive the offer within 30 seconds

2. **Test Status Persistence**:
   - Driver goes online
   - Refresh the page
   - Driver should remain online

3. **Test Calendar Integration**:
   - Driver accepts a ride offer
   - Check driver calendar
   - Accepted ride should appear in calendar

## Next Steps

1. Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets
2. Add push notifications for mobile apps
3. Implement Celery for scheduled matching tasks
4. Add driver location tracking for proximity-based matching
