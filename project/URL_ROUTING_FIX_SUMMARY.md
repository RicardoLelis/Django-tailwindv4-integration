# URL Routing Fix Summary

## Issue
NoReverseMatch error for 'pre_book_ride' URL pattern preventing access to pre-booking features.

## Root Cause
The project's main URL configuration (project/urls.py) was importing views directly instead of including the app's URL configuration. This caused the pre-booking URL patterns to not be registered.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated project/urls.py
Changed from importing individual views to using Django's include() pattern:
```python
# Before (problematic):
from app.views import landing_page, login_view, ...
urlpatterns = [
    path('', landing_page, name='landing_page'),
    # ... individual patterns
]

# After (fixed):
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # Password reset URLs (keep at project level)
    path('password-reset/', CustomPasswordResetView.as_view(), name='password_reset'),
    # Include all app URLs
    path('', include('app.urls')),
]
```

### 2. Fixed app/urls.py imports
- Added import for views from views_package: `from .views_package import *`
- Updated URL patterns to use the correct view references (removed `views.` prefix for views from views_package)

### 3. Organized views structure
- Moved driver_status_views.py from app/views/ to app/views_package/
- Added missing confirm_booking view to booking_views.py
- Updated views_package/__init__.py to properly export all views

### 4. Fixed requirements.txt format
Updated version specifiers from `>=X.Y<X.Z` to `>=X.Y,<X.Z` for proper pip parsing.

## Result
✅ Django server now starts successfully
✅ All URL patterns are properly registered
✅ Pre-booking functionality is accessible at /pre-book/
✅ Driver status management endpoints are available
✅ Centralized URL management for better maintainability

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Restart the Django development server
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/
3. Click the "Pre-Book Ride" button
4. The pre-booking form should load without errors
