## Local Market Reality - Lisbon Area Trips

Trips payed so far:

São José -> Queluz
    - distance (one leg only): 16km, cost: €35
São José -> Queluz

    - distance (one leg only): 22km, cost: €50
Queluz -> Hospital Amadora Sintra (HFF)(round trip)
    - distance (one leg only): 4km, cost: €30

### Price Analysis
- **Average cost per km**: €2.54
- **Standard taxi rate in Portugal**: €0.50/km
- **Accessible transport premium**: 5x standard rates (currently too high)
- **Average trip distance**: 15.6km
- **Average trip cost**: €43

### Fair Pricing Assessment
**Current pricing is excessive.** While accessible transport justifies higher costs due to:
- Specialized vehicles (€40-60k for adapted VW Caddy)
- Additional boarding/assistance time (5-10 minutes extra)
- Limited driver availability
- Specialized training requirements

**A 2-3x premium (€1.00-1.50/km) would be more reasonable** than the current 5x premium.

### Recommended Pricing Model
- **Base fare**: €3.50 (same as regular taxi)
- **Per km rate**: €1.20 (2.4x standard rate)
- **Waiting time**: €0.50/minute (during boarding/assistance)
- **Equipment fee**: €5 flat (if wheelchair lift/ramp used)

**Example Trip Calculations**:
- Queluz → Alcoitão (20km): €3.50 + (20 × €1.20) + €5 = €32.50 (vs €80 currently)
- São José → Queluz (16km): €3.50 + (16 × €1.20) + €5 = €27.70 (vs €35-40 currently)
- This provides drivers €20-25 per trip while remaining affordable for users

### Pricing Comparison with Ride-Sharing Platforms

**Standard Ride-Sharing (Uber/Bolt) in Portugal**:
- **Base fare**: €1.50-2.00
- **Per km rate**: €0.60-0.80
- **Per minute**: €0.15-0.20
- **Minimum fare**: €3.50-4.00
- **Surge pricing**: Up to 2-3x during peak times

**RideConnect vs Standard Platforms**:

| Component | RideConnect | Uber/Bolt | Premium Factor |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Base fare | €3.50 | €1.50-2.00 | +75-133% |
| Per km | €1.20 | €0.60-0.80 | +50-100% |
| Waiting time | €0.50/min | €0.15-0.20/min | +150-233% |
| Equipment fee | €5.00 | N/A | Unique to accessible transport |
| Surge pricing | None | Up to 3x | Fair, regulated pricing |

**Justification for Premium Pricing**:
1. **Specialized vehicles**: Adapted vehicles cost €40-60k (vs €15-25k standard)
2. **Extended service time**: 5-10 minutes additional boarding/assistance
3. **Driver expertise**: Specialized training for disability assistance
4. **Equipment maintenance**: Wheelchair lifts, ramps, securing systems
5. **Lower utilization**: Fewer trips per hour due to longer service times
6. **Insurance costs**: Higher premiums for specialized transport

**Value Proposition**: While RideConnect charges 2-3x standard rates, it's 50% cheaper than current accessible transport options (€2.54/km) while providing professional, reliable service with trained drivers.
