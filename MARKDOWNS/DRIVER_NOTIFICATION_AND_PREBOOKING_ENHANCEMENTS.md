# Driver Notification and Pre-Booking Enhancements

## Overview

This document summarizes the enhancements made to address the following concerns:
1. Driver notification system for pending ride requests
2. "Go Online" functionality for drivers
3. Round-trip toggle for riders
4. Pricing estimation with distance calculation

## 1. Driver Status Management & Notifications

### New Components Created:

#### **Driver Status Views** (`views/driver_status_views.py`)
- `toggle_driver_status`: Handles driver online/offline status changes
- `update_driver_location`: Updates driver's current GPS location
- `driver_live_offers`: Returns pending ride offers for online drivers
- `check_and_notify_pending_rides`: Automatically matches online drivers with pending rides

#### **Notification Service** (`services/notification_service.py`)
- Email notifications for new ride offers
- Rider notifications when rides are accepted
- Ride reminders for drivers
- Placeholder methods for future push notifications and SMS

### How It Works:

1. **Driver Goes Online**:
   - Driver clicks "Go Online" button in dashboard
   - System requests location permission
   - Creates a new driver session
   - Immediately checks for pending rides in the area
   - Creates match offers for suitable rides

2. **Automatic Matching**:
   - When a driver goes online, the system:
     - Finds all pending pre-booked rides
     - Calculates match scores based on distance, availability, and requirements
     - Creates offers for rides with scores > 60%
     - Sends email notifications to the driver

3. **Live Updates**:
   - Driver location updates every 30 seconds
   - New offers checked every 30 seconds
   - Offers displayed in real-time on dashboard

## 2. Enhanced Driver Dashboard

### New Features:

1. **Go Online/Offline Toggle**:
   ```javascript
   - Green "Go Online" button when offline
   - Red "Go Offline" button when online
   - Loading spinner during status change
   - Only visible for approved drivers
   ```

2. **Live Offers Panel**:
   - Shows pending ride requests when online
   - Displays key information:
     - Pickup/dropoff locations
     - Estimated fare and distance
     - Time until pickup
     - Special requirements
     - Accept/Decline buttons
     - Offer expiration timer

3. **Location Tracking**:
   - Automatic location updates when online
   - Used for proximity-based matching

## 3. Pre-Booking Enhancements for Riders

### New Pre-Book Ride Form Features:

1. **Round-Trip Toggle**:
   - Visual toggle switch for round-trip bookings
   - When enabled, shows:
     - Return time selector
     - Flexible return option
     - Estimated wait time dropdown
   - 10% discount automatically applied

2. **Pricing Estimation**:
   - Real-time fare calculation as user types
   - Shows:
     - Distance estimate
     - Duration estimate
     - Base fare breakdown
     - Round-trip discount (if applicable)
     - Priority surcharge (if selected)
     - Total fare estimate

3. **Medical Appointment Features**:
   - Quick selection of medical facilities
   - Purpose-based ride categorization
   - Accessibility requirements section

4. **Enhanced Location Selection**:
   - Recent locations for quick selection
   - Medical facilities suggestion when medical purpose selected
   - Auto-calculation when location selected

### Updated Home Page:

## 4. Distance and Fare Calculation

### Enhanced Geocoding Service:
- Mock implementation using Lisbon coordinates
- Haversine formula for distance calculation
- Traffic-adjusted duration estimates
- Lisbon taxi rates for fare calculation

### AJAX Endpoint Updates:
- `/ajax/geocode/` now supports:
  - Single address geocoding
  - Route calculation with distance/duration
  - Fare estimation
- Returns structured data for form integration

## 5. URL Configuration

Added new URL patterns:
```python
# Driver status management
path('driver/toggle-status/', views.toggle_driver_status, name='toggle_driver_status'),
path('driver/update-location/', views.update_driver_location, name='update_driver_location'),
path('driver/live-offers/', views.driver_live_offers, name='driver_live_offers'),
```

## 6. Development Mode

The driver dashboard includes a development mode for testing:
```javascript
const DEVELOPMENT_MODE = true; // Set to false for production
```

When enabled:
- Simulates status changes
- Generates mock ride offers
- Tests UI without backend

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. **Real-Time Updates**:
- Implement WebSocket connections for instant notifications
- Replace polling with push updates

### 2. **Push Notifications**:
- Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging for mobile apps
- Add browser push notifications for web

### 3. **SMS Integration**:
- Add Twilio for SMS notifications
- Send alerts for urgent rides

### 4. **Real Geocoding**:
- Replace mock geocoding with Google Maps API
- Add actual route calculation
- Traffic-aware duration estimates

### 5. **Background Tasks**:
- Use Celery for:
  - Periodic matching runs
  - Notification queuing
  - Performance analytics

## Testing the Implementation

1. Complete driver registration and get approved
2. Go to driver dashboard
3. Click "Go Online" and allow location access
4. Wait for ride offers to appear
5. Accept or decline offers
