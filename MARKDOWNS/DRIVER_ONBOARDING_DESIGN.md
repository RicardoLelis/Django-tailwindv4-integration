## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Backend Architecture
```python
# State machine for application status
class DriverApplicationStatus:
    STARTED = 'started'
    DOCUMENTS_UPLOADED = 'documents_uploaded'
    BACKGROUND_CHECK_PENDING = 'background_check_pending'
    TRAINING_IN_PROGRESS = 'training_in_progress'
    ASSESSMENT_SCHEDULED = 'assessment_scheduled'
    APPROVED = 'approved'
    REJECTED = 'rejected'
    SUSPENDED = 'suspended'
```

### Security Measures
1. **Document Encryption**: All uploads encrypted at rest
2. **PII Protection**: Sensitive data masked in UI
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all status changes
4. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for reviewers
5. **Data Retention**: Automatic purge of rejected applications after 90 days

### Integration Points
1. **Background Check API**: Integrate with Portuguese criminal records
2. **Vehicle Registry API**: Auto-populate vehicle details
3. **SMS Verification**: Twilio for phone verification
4. **Document OCR**: Google Vision API or similar
5. **Training Platform**: LMS integration or custom build
