## üöÄ Application Flow

### Phase 1: Rider Request Initiation

#### 1.1 Map Initialization
```
- Load Lisbon PMTiles from Cloudflare R2
- Initialize MapLibre GL with Protomaps tiles
- Display Lisbon district map centered on user location
```

#### 1.2 Location Input Process
**Option A: Current Location as Pickup**
- Request HTML5 geolocation permissions
- Get GPS coordinates
- Reverse geocode coordinates using Nominatim API
- Display pickup address on map with marker

**Option B: Manual Pickup Entry**
- User types pickup address in search field
- Query Nominatim API for address suggestions
- User selects from dropdown results
- Forward geocode to get coordinates
- Place pickup marker on map

#### 1.3 Destination Input
- User types destination address
- Query Nominatim API for Lisbon area suggestions
- User selects destination from results
- Forward geocode destination address
- Place destination marker on map

### Phase 2: Route & Price Calculation

#### 2.1 Route Generation
```
Input: Pickup coordinates, Destination coordinates
Process: 
  - Call OpenRouteService API with coordinates
  - Specify vehicle profile: wheelchair-accessible vehicle
  - Get route geometry, distance, and estimated time
  - Draw route polyline on Protomaps display
Output: Route visualization with pickup/destination markers
```

#### 2.2 Price Estimation Algorithm
```
Base Calculation:
  - Base fare: ‚Ç¨3.50 (wheelchair accessibility premium)
  - Distance rate: ‚Ç¨1.40 per km
  - Time rate: ‚Ç¨0.30 per minute
  - Accessibility surcharge: ‚Ç¨2.00
  
Dynamic Factors:
  - Peak hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM): +25%
  - Late night (11 PM - 6 AM): +30%
  - Airport/hospital zones: +‚Ç¨1.50
  
Formula:
  Total = (Base + Distance√óRate + Time√óRate + Accessibility) √ó Peak_Multiplier + Zone_Premium
```

#### 2.3 Pre-Booking Confirmation
- Display route on map (no removal of other UI elements)
- Show price breakdown in sidebar/modal
- Display estimated ride duration
- Show wheelchair accessibility confirmation
- "Request Ride" button activation

### Phase 3: Driver Broadcasting System

#### 3.1 Driver Pool Filtering
```
Criteria for suitable drivers:
  - Currently online and available
  - Wheelchair-accessible vehicle certified

```

#### 3.2 Broadcasting Logic
```
Priority Algorithm:
  1. Distance from pickup (closest first)
  2. Driver rating (highest first)
  3. Wheelchair experience score
  4. Response time history

Broadcast Process:
  - Send push notification to top 5 qualified drivers
  - Include: pickup address, destination, estimated fare, wheelchair note
  - 60-second response window
  - If no response, broadcast to next 5 drivers
```

#### 3.3 Driver Response Handling
